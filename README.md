COMP1003 is a first year uni module that focuses on Algorithms, data structures and mathematics.

Here there are two simple practices using C#. One using a map to store keys and data, and the other that uses breadth-first search in an undirected graph, specificially handling what to do when a node is 'down'. The nodes are treated as if they were computers in a network.
